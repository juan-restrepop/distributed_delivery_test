# On the approach followed
One of the most powerful framework to encourage tight collaboration and understanding between developers and designers is Atomic Design. In this sense I tried to establish a very basic workflow to enforce a design system.

I have done this work in a couple of hours where establishing a proper design system is an ever evolving endeavour between designers and developers but the work done here should give an over-simplified and basic insight into this approach.

Of course a proper documentation (see the IBM's design system below) is required as well as the right tools to help the collaboration (I have experience with Sketch and Zeplin).
